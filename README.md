# libconnect

Libconnect is an TYPO3 extension which was initially developed by Avonis for the Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Hamburg Carl von Ossietzky (SUB).
The SUB maintains it now.
With libconnect it is possible to display the information of EZB and DBIS of the University Regensburg on an TYPO3 based website.

Here is the German [Manual](doc/manual.pdf "Ausführliches Manual").

## 7.0.10
    - EZB:
       - Fixed error: no search results, if someone uses in extended search only jq_term2 or higher. Http_built_query removed elements with null values and the API do not accept the other parameters.
       - Changed domain in URL from ezb.uni-regensburg.de to ezb.ur.de
       - Changed URLs for XML from http to https

Tested with 
    - TYPO3 8.7.25
    - TYPO3 9.5.4

## Configuration

1. Include static template

        plugin.tx_libconnect {
            ezbbibid = SUBHH
            dbisbibid = sub_hh
            zdbsid = vid:dbid
        }

## Customize your design

### Set paths to templates, partials and layouts

        plugin.tx_libconnect {
            view {
                templateRootPaths {
                    0 = EXT:libconnect/Resources/Private/Templates/
                    1 = <yourPath>
                }
                partialRootPaths {
                    0 = EXT:libconnect/Resources/Private/Partials/
                    1 = <yourPath>
                }
